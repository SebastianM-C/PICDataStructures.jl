By default it creates a new figure with Figure()\nfigurepos: The FigurePosition to use. The default is fig[1,1]\nxlabel: The labes of the x axis of the figure. By default is determined with axisnames\nylabel: The labes of the y axis of the figure. By default is determined with axisnames\nzlabel: The labes of the z axis of the figure. By default is determined with axisnames\ntitle: The figure title. Empty (\"\") by default\ndownsample_size: Thw approximate downsample size for the input data.\n\nBy default (:default), it uses the heuristic values in downsample. If you want to avoid downsampling the data, use nothing. Otherwise, the argument is the approximate maiximun size along any direction.\n\ncbar_orientation: The orientation of the attached Colorbar.
